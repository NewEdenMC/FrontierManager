# lastReset: Unix timestamp of last reset, this value is set automatically by the plugin, no need to set
#
# You can however use this value to set this value to a timestamp in the future in order to 
# specify exactly when the first or next reset will take place, to do this get the Unix 
# timestamp of the current time, then add the required amount of time in seconds. The plugin
# will then wait until the time stamp specified has passed then use the resetFrequency value
# to schedule the next reset.
lastReset: 0

# resetFrequency: Define the time between resets, this is done using months, days and hours
# in the format "mm dd hh", for example "01 01 03", so with this value the reset would happen
# every 1 month, on the 1st of the month, at 0300 hours.
resetFrequency: 01 01 03

warnChat: true
