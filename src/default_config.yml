# Some time values in this section are defined using a human readable time format of
# "<month> <dayOfMonth> <timeOfDay>", timeOfDay being in 24 hour time.  For example:
# - "0 15 0" means 15 days
# - "1 15 0" means 1 month and 15 days
# - "1 15 1200" means 1 month, 15 days and 12 hours
# - "1 15 1230" means 1 month, 15 days, 12 hours and 30 minutes
schedule:
   
   # lastReset: Unix timestamp of last reset, this value is set automatically by the plugin, no need to set
   #
   # You can set this value to a timestamp in the future in order to specify exactly when the first or next
   # reset will take place, to do this get the Unix timestamp of the current time, then add the required
   # amount of time in seconds. The plugin will then wait until the timestamp specified has passed then
   # use the timeToNextReset value below to schedule the next reset.
   lastReset: 0
   
   # timeToNextReset: Define the time that should pass from the last reset to the next resets, define
   # this value using the human readable time formant explained at the top of this section.
   # 
   # For example the value "1 0 0" would cause the reset to happen exactly 1 month from the lastReset
   # time above, or with the value "0 15 1230", the next reset would happen exactly 15 days, 12 hours
   # and 30 minutes from the the lastReset time above.
